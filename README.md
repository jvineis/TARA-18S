# TARA-18S
### Most of the work outlined here is from my work with Bess Ward and others in her lab at Princeton. Its just a reference for us to recreate our analysis, but could be useful to others. Its  unlikely that I will maintain the scripts in this directory, but I might be able to help if you are really stuck. Keep in mind that 18S is probs really not very good for much and many organisms have tons of copies of this gene within a single cell. Anyway. Its fun to analyze and sometimes we learn things. 
### I use conda to download almost all software needed for the analysis below. 
1.Download the data from SRA.All you need is an SRA number and sratools to get download the fastq files for analysis. I used conda to install sratools.
